# VIB and Attention Mechanisms for Inverse Design of High-Hardness Multicomponent Metallic Glasses (MMGs)

This repository hosts the codebase, dataset, and pretrained models used in our study on **Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)** and **Attention-based Neural Networks** for **inverse design of high-hardness multicomponent metallic glasses (MMGs)**. The proposed framework integrates probabilistic latent representations and attention mechanisms to learn composition–hardness relationships and to discover new glassy compositions with extreme mechanical performance.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Forward Model**: Predicts Vickers hardness (HV) from alloy composition using:
  - Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) networks
  - Attention over elemental fractions and latent features
  - Baseline regression models for benchmarking

- **Inverse Design Module**: Generates novel alloy compositions targeting a desired hardness using:
  - Latent space optimization and sampling
  - Composition vector normalization
  - Constraints on element fraction summation (∑xᵢ = 1)

- **Dataset**: Empirical and simulated data for known MMGs, including:
  - Elemental compositions
  - Experimental hardness values (HV)

## Forward Model: VIB + Attention

The model architecture implements:

- **VIB Encoder**: Compresses input composition to latent Gaussian space
- **KL Annealing**: Gradually activates KL regularization during training
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Attends to element-specific latent features
- **Regression Head**: Outputs predicted hardness value

---

## Baseline Models

Implemented in `Other Regression Models.py`:

- Random Forest Regressor  
- Support Vector Regression  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- XGBoost  
- k-NN  
- MLP Regressor  

Performance comparison includes RMSE and R² metrics for each.

## Inverse Design Pipeline

Implemented in: `Inverse_Design_Module.ipynb`

### Workflow:
1. **Latent sampling** around known high-HV clusters
2. **Target-guided optimization** of latent vector toward desired HV
3. **Decoding** into alloy compositions
4. **Post-processing** to ensure:
   - Non-negativity (xᵢ ≥ 0)
   - Normalization (∑xᵢ = 1)
   - Filter based on GFA constraints (optional)
